            Our poolside suite has a separate entrance from 
            the main house and can be accessed from the 
            street without disturbing the residents of the 
            house. The suite has one bedroom with a quee
            size bed and a private bathroom. We can provide 
            a cot to squeeze in a third person. The suite opens 
            to and overlooks our swimming pool (solar heated 
            in summer), which is available to guests. Free 
            street parking. Easy access to public transportation. 
            Bicycles available for guest use.</p>
            
            <p>We've added a coffee-maker and a microwave at 
            the suggestion of previous guests, although the 
            host will often provide hot coffee at 8 a.m.. and 
            there is a coffee shop within easy walking distance.</p>
            <p>
            If you are looking to stay more than a couple of 
            days, you should be aware of the kitchen situation. 
            The house has a kitchen, but we only allow you to 
            bring in strictly vegetarian foods, and the house is 
            only open when someone is home. (More often 
            than not, but not always). On the other hand, we 
            have a refrigerator/freezer for use in the garage 
            attached to the suite, and we will provide a 
            camping stove or gas powered bar-b-q to use by 
            the pool We can also provide pots and pans, 
            plastic plates and bowls, and plastic knives and 
            forks.
